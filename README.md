 # Juggling Football Counter

The Juggling Football Counter is a project that utilizes deep-learning technologies to automatically count the number of juggles performed with a football. It uses YOLOv8 object detection, pose detection, and object tracking. The algorithm for juggling counting is implemented in `utils.py` based on code from the supervision library, specifically the `line_counter` module.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to count juggling football using YOLOv8 object detection, pose detection, and object tracking. Two YOLOv8 models are employed - `yolov8n-pose.pt` for key point detection and `yolov8n.pt` for soccer ball detection.
